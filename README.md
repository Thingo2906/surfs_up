# surfs_up
## Overview of the statistical analysis:
- The goal of our research is to look at temperature data between June and December to determine if having a surf shop year-round is feasible. The temperature data is obtained by doing two separate queries, one for June and the other for December. We save the temps in a list and then transform them to a dataframe after we execute our queries. Using the.describe() method, we can receive our summary statistics after our dataframe has been constructed.
## Results:
- In June:

## Summary:
- We can identify what our temps are based on our data, but because weather has other qualities like as precipitation, we may run extra queries to determine whether or not customers can visit the business. We can perform even more queries if we can get additional data for the area! From there, we can select how we want to construct the business and what sections will make it a more visible destination for tourists.
